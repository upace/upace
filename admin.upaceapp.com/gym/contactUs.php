EQUITABLE RELIEF

If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law

interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision 

within the limits of applicable law or the applicable court decisions.

WAIVER

Any waiver by UPACE of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as or 

be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other 

provision of this Agreement. Any waiver must be in writing. Failure by UPACE to insist upon 

strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered 

a waiver or deprive UPACE of the right to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other 

term of this Agreement.

Application, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, including without limitation

• If UPACE is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets 

We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you 

affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third 

party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion that we advertise through the 

Application or on one of our web sites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third 

party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do 

not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing 

from a third party, your information will be subject to that party’s privacy policy. If you later 

decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact that 

third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any party that collects 

your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

The Application may use third party authorized service providers to provide us with analytical 

data about your use of the Application. We may deploy devices, such as cookies, that enable 

those third parties to anonymously collect and aggregate usage data and report it back to 

us. Third parties that we engage to provide analytics services and to assist in providing the 

Application’s tools and services cannot use your personal information for their own purposes, 

unrelated to the Application, without your explicit consent 

THIRD-PARTY SITES

The Application contains links to web sites and other applications that provide services related 

to the Application (such as payment processing services and university information websites) 

or that we believe you might find useful and informative. Also, the Application may utilize 

social networking sites that are not owned or controlled by UPACE. Please be aware, however, 

that UPACE does not endorse or recommend the content or services of such web sites or 

applications, and UPACE is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other 

sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each web site and application you visit 

and use. 

SECURITY

UPACE will maintain appropriate safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 

of any customer information under UPACE’s control. Please be aware that the transmission 

of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure, and, although we 

endeavor to provide reasonable security measures, no security systems can prevent all potential 

security breaches. 

OPT-OUT PROCEDURES

You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling the Application 

from your mobile device. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as 

part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

You can also withdraw your consent to receive “push” notifications and/or to the collection of 

your physical location information at any time by disabling or changing the related functionality 

or setting as provided in your mobile device.
