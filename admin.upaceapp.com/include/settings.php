interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision 

within the limits of applicable law or the applicable court decisions.

WAIVER

Any waiver by UPACE of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as or 

be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other 

provision of this Agreement. Any waiver must be in writing. Failure by UPACE to insist upon 

strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered 

a waiver or deprive UPACE of the right to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other 

term of this Agreement.

Application, with or without notice, for any reason or no reason, including without limitation

Please note that the Application may contain links to content providers that collect information 

from children under the age of 18. We have no control over such content providers and are not

affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third 

party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion that we advertise through the 

Application or on one of our web sites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third 

party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do 

not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing 

from a third party, your information will be subject to that party’s privacy policy. If you later

third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any party that collects

those third parties to anonymously collect and aggregate usage data and report it back to

Application’s tools and services cannot use your personal information for their own purposes, 

unrelated to the Application, without your explicit consent
