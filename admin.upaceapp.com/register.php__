OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

As a general matter, we seek to use information collected through the Application to enhance 

the experience of users of our services. We (including our affiliates and authorized service 

providers) may use this information in a number of ways, including:

• To furnish you with products or services you have requested, or to send you information 

or otherwise contact you about UPACE, or its affiliates, their products, services, 

advertising, upcoming events, special offers or promotions, text messages, or for other 

purposes disclosed when you submit your information by using the Application. 

• To assist us in marketing and advertising our products and services and those of other 

businesses. 

• To improve the content and functionality of the Application. 

• To prevent and detect fraud, infringement, and other potential misuse of the Application.

maintain on an aggregate basis, with third parties who provide services to UPACE and 

its affiliates, such as credit card processing, customer services, order fulfillment, and/or

Application features are most popular and useful to users, and for other statistical 

analyses.

• To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy 

• To customize the content or services on the Application for you, or the communications 

sent to you through the Application

TEXT MESSAGING

By opting in to receive text messages, you agree that UPACE may send you marketing text 

or e-mail messages at that telephone number using an automatic telephone dialing system. 

These messages may include Short Message Service (“SMS”) messages. 

CHILDREN'S GUIDELINES

UPACE does not specifically target the Application or any of its mobile services to children 

under 18 years old. If you are under the age of 18 and a registered college student, you may use 

the Application only with the permission and under the supervision of a parent or guardian. If a 

parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without 

their consent, he or she should contact us.

Please note that the Application may contain links to content providers that collect information 

from children under the age of 18. We have no control over such content providers and are not 

responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites or mobile applications. 

Because the Internet and mobile applications offer open access to a wide range of information, 

it is important that parents supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, email or chat 

sessions. 

TRACKING, DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

We may disclose your Device and Physical Location:

• As provided in this Mobile Privacy Policy; 

• As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; 

• When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect 

your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request; 

• With our authorized service providers who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in 

this Mobile Privacy Policy; 

• If UPACE is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets 

We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you 

affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third 

party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion that we advertise through the 

Application or on one of our web sites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third 

party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do 

not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing 

from a third party, your information will be subject to that party’s privacy policy. If you later 

decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact that 

third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any party that collects 

your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

The Application may use third party authorized service providers to provide us with analytical 

data about your use of the Application. We may deploy devices, such as cookies, that enable 

those third parties to anonymously collect and aggregate usage data and report it back to 

us. Third parties that we engage to provide analytics services and to assist in providing the 

Application’s tools and services cannot use your personal information for their own purposes, 

unrelated to the Application, without your explicit consent 

THIRD-PARTY SITES

The Application contains links to web sites and other applications that provide services related 

to the Application (such as payment processing services and university information websites) 

or that we believe you might find useful and informative. Also, the Application may utilize 

social networking sites that are not owned or controlled by UPACE. Please be aware, however, 

that UPACE does not endorse or recommend the content or services of such web sites or 

applications, and UPACE is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other 

sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each web site and application you visit 

and use. 

SECURITY

UPACE will maintain appropriate safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 

of any customer information under UPACE’s control. Please be aware that the transmission 

of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure, and, although we 

endeavor to provide reasonable security measures, no security systems can prevent all potential 

security breaches.

from your mobile device. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as 

part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

Any waiver by UPACE of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as or

Please note that the Application may contain links to content providers that collect information 

from children under the age of 18. We have no control over such content providers and are not 

responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites or mobile applications.

sessions. 

TRACKING, DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

We may disclose your Device and Physical Location:

affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third 

party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion that we advertise through the 

Application or on one of our web sites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third 

party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do 

not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing 

from a third party, your information will be subject to that party’s privacy policy. If you later 

decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact that 

third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any party that collects 

your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

The Application may use third party authorized service providers to provide us with analytical 

data about your use of the Application. We may deploy devices, such as cookies, that enable 

those third parties to anonymously collect and aggregate usage data and report it back to 

us. Third parties that we engage to provide analytics services and to assist in providing the 

Application’s tools and services cannot use your personal information for their own purposes, 

unrelated to the Application, without your explicit consent 

THIRD-PARTY SITES

The Application contains links to web sites and other applications that provide services related 

to the Application (such as payment processing services and university information websites) 

or that we believe you might find useful and informative. Also, the Application may utilize 

social networking sites that are not owned or controlled by UPACE. Please be aware, however, 

that UPACE does not endorse or recommend the content or services of such web sites or 

applications, and UPACE is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other 

sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each web site and application you visit 

and use. 

SECURITY

UPACE will maintain appropriate safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 

of any customer information under UPACE’s control. Please be aware that the transmission 

of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure, and, although we

security breaches.
